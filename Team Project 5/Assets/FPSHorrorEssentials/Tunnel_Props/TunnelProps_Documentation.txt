Tunnel Props Pack

Thank you for your purchase.

I have create a simple set of tunnel sections which snap to grid points of 2.5, 
seam lines or connecting points should be covered with the splitter piece if you see any floating point or geometry issues.
The Current textures are good to get started but it is reccomended to swap out textures if you can. That way this pack will look more unique 
for your project.
